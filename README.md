# house_kg_prices

Parsing the data from house.kg and further linear ML models building for price prediction.

Parsing file was got from https://github.com/IslamJenishbekov/flats_project_house_kg/tree/main.

The image parser (flats_image_parser.ipynb) was written and is capable to download the images using their links contained in flats_unique.csv.

The mapping (`flat_url`, `image_url`, `image_name`) is in file url_iamges_0_4484.csv.

The file download_errors_0_4484.csv contains the urls of flats which either don't exist or don't contain images or have some troubles with downloading.

The photos themselves are in zip archives available on by this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15y-nMhfW_dCFs1DrPq3x9tAwhno7Vevp?usp=drive_link).
The numbers in archive names indicate to start and end of indices of flats in flats_unique.csv.
